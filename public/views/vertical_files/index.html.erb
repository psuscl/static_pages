<h2>University Archives Vertical Files</h2>
<p>The University Archives’ vertical files were begun in the early 1940s by the librarians working in the Penn State Room (which later became the University Archives). The librarians utilized a system created by the public relations office to manage news reports about the University – a clippings service. The clippings had to relate directly to Penn State in some manner and were extracted from local, national and international news and magazine sources as necessary. The clippings were divided into categories (delineated below) and filed in vertical file cabinets (hence their name). Over the years, the vertical files grew to include all manner of publications: flyers, newsletters, brochures, journal articles, and single item manuscripts. These resources provide ready reference about Penn State.</p>
<p>General and Biographical vertical files have continued to grow over the years, as documents were shared by public Information offices across campus as well as from individual donors. Photographic vertical files were specifically compiled from archival transfers of photographs from the Office of Public Information, the <i>Daily Collegian</i>, the <i>LaVie</i> yearbook, research publications, individual colleges and departments, and staff photographers. University Archives personnel were also engaged in actively expanding vertical files up until 2019 when additions to vertical files ceased altogether.</p>
<p>The vertical files do not always provide comprehensive coverage of their topics, and vary in their quantity and depth of information.</p>
